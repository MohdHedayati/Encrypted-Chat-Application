# What Spring(Boot) simplifies
1. Application have servers -> manual setup 
2. Applications use dependencies -> Installation,set up 
3. Organisation,structure of application. 
4. Repetitive code-> boilerplate code.
5. Testing of application -> tedious and manual.

***Spring gives you a frame in which you can work , spring boot gives you everything pre-made to start with in the framework, maven organise and brings all the tools needed.
